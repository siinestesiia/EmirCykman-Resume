I have been passionate about video games since childhood and i always found computer graphics breathtaking. This passion eventually led me to programming. I'm constantly learning new things regarding both design and technology. Each personal project I undertake in my spare time is a new challenge that rewards me with valuable experience.


## **Personal Projects**

In 2022 I started learning **Python** from books and online resources. I've written a few programs, including simple videogames and process automation tools.

For example: 
* Pygame videogame ["Shooter Game"](https://github.com/siinestesiia/shooter_game).
* Automation tool ["Blender Project Directory Creator"](https://github.com/siinestesiia/Blender_Project_Directory).

Although I briefly explored **C#** during 2020 for game development with **Unity**, I recently developed a deeper interest in the language and committed to diving deeper into it.
I recently started to learn **.NET MAUI** for cross-platform app development.
* Videogame written in **C#** ["Break It!"](https://github.com/siinestesiia/Break_It/tree/main/Break_It!_Project/Assets/Scripts).
* **C#** console game ["Rock, Paper and Scissors"](https://github.com/siinestesiia/RockPaperScissors/blob/main/RockPaperScissors.cs).
  
I continue to learn new things as I keep programming and challenge myself.


## **Education**

* I began studying Image and Sound Design at the **University of Buenos Aires** However, I decided to switch careers as the program became more political than artistic. Although I did not complete my second year, I gained valuable skills during my time there.   
* Next year I will be starting the **Software Engineering** program at the university.


## **Working Experience**

* Since 2016 I have repaired smartphones and other electronic devices. I can diagnose the problem and proceed to repairs when possible, including replacing components or soldering new ones.
* I also have extensive experience in customer service, having worked in the gastronomic field for many years.
* While I haven't yet worked in the IT industry, I'm eager to gain experience and learn along the way.


## **Programming Languages**

* Intermediate proficiency in **Python** and **C#**.
* I am actively re-learning C# to use it with **Unity**, **MAUI** or just a **Console App**.


## **Software**
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **IDE's:** Visual Studio / VS Code.
* **Python Libraries:** sqlite3, Pygame, PIL.
* **Game engine:** Unity


## **Languages**

* Fluent in **Spanish** (native)
* Proficient in **English** (advanced) 
* Intermediate in **French**.
